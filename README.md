# Multimodal RAG System Chat
### Overview
The Multimodal RAG System Chat lets you interact with an AI using text and video. It processes different types of inputs to generate intelligent, relevant responses. This system is designed for fast, local inference without relying on external APIs. (thou  its still in process)

### Features
Text chat: Talk to the AI with natural language.
Image analysis: Upload images for the AI to analyze. (not main purpose)
Video interaction: Submit videos for analysis and get insights.
